# Advent of Code 2019 in Rust
This repository contains solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems in Rust.

# Running the tests
[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if necessary, then run tests with:

```
cargo test
```

# Running the solutions against custom input
To run a solution against given input on stdin:

```sh
# Debug mode:
cargo run -q <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt
# Release mode:
cargo run -q --release <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt

# Examples:
cargo run 2 1 < path/to/input_day2_part1.txt
```

# Running using Docker
A published Docker image can be used to run against custom input:

```sh
docker run -i fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code-2019-rs:latest <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt

# Example:
docker run -i fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code-2019-rs:latest 1 1 < src/day1_input.txt
```

# Libraries
The `solve(day, part, input)` library function is published on these package repositories:

- [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/advent_of_code_rs) for the Rust library.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/advent_of_code_rs_wasm) for a Node.js library using WebAssembly built by [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-rs-python) for a Python library using [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) and built with [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/).

```rust
fn todo() {}
```

```python
# Python with dependency added: pip install --upgrade advent-of-code-rs-python
>>> import advent_of_code_rs_python
>>> advent_of_code_rs_python.solve(1, 1, "12")
'2'
```

```js
// Node.js with dependency added: npm add advent_of_code_rs_wasm
const assert = require('assert').strict;
const solve = require('advent_of_code_rs_wasm').solve;

assert.equal(solve(1, 1, '14'), '2');
assert.equal(solve(3, 2, "R8,U5,L5,D3\nU7,R6,D4,L4"), '30');
```

# Command line tools
All tools are invoked with day and part as arguments, and expect input on stdin:

```sh
$ $TOOL $DAY $PART < $INPUT
```

## Rust tool installable from crates.io
```sh
$ cargo install advent_of_code_rs
# [..]
$ echo 14 | advent_of_code_rs 1 1
2
```

## Node tool installable from npm
```sh
$ npm install advent_of_code_rs_wasm -g
# [..]
$ echo 14 | advent-of-code-wasm 1 1
2
```

## Python tool installable from PyPi
```sh
$ echo TODO
```

# Running in the browser
The solutions can run using WebAssembly at https://advent2019.fornwall.net.

# Post to HTTP endpoint
There is a HTTP endpoint running on [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) (using Node.js and WebAssembly) that can be used as follows:

```sh
$Â curl --data-binary @crates/core/src/day02_input.txt \
     "https://advent2019.fornwall.net/.netlify/functions/solve?day=2&part=2"
```
