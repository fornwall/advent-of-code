# Advent of Code 2019 in Rust
This repository contains solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems in Rust.

# Running the tests
[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if necessary, then run tests with:

    cargo test

# Running the solutions against custom input
To run a solution against given input on stdin:

    cargo run <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt

    # Examples:
    cargo run 2 1 < path/to/input_day2_part1.txt
    curl https://example.com/example-input | cargo run 2 1

# Running using Docker
There is also a Docker image published for running the tests:

    docker run -i fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code-2019-rs:latest <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt

    # Example:
    docker run -i fredrikfornwall/advent-of-code-2019-rs:latest 1 1 < src/day1_input.txt

# Running using Node.js
As a proof of concept, an [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/advent_of_code_rs) is available which uses WebAssembly to execute the solution:

    # Installation:
    npm install advent_of_code_rs_bin -g

    # Invocation:
    advent-of-code-rs <day> <part> < path/to/input.txt

# Running in the browser
As another proof of concept the solution can run inside the browser at https://fornwall.net/advent-of-code-2019/.
